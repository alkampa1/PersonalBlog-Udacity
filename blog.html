                <p>
                    Colombia is more than twice the size of France or Spain and has the same length of coastline as the
                    U.S.
                    pacific coast. Basically it’s a massive country. Luckily with its many public bus systems and
                    chartered
                    transport it’s relatively easy to get around. It just takes some time. Get used to those long
                    beautiful
                    bus rides.
                </p>
                <p>The Republic of Colombia is a unitary, democratic, participatory and pluralistic State with
                    separation of powers. The President is elected by popular vote for a period of four years.

                    With more than 9 million of votes, the highest obtained by any candidate in the history of
                    Colombian
                    democracy, the current President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos-Calderón, was elected for the
                    period 2010 - 2014.</p>

                        <h3>Colombia has a Naturally Occurring Rainbow River</h3>
                        <p>Caño Cristales, also known as the river of 5 colors, is a brightly hued freshwater river
                            whose
                            aquatic plants and algae have created a red, blue, orange, yellow, and green flowing stream.
                            The
                            vibrant water is unique and colors like this are found in no other streams on earth.</p>

                        <h3>Colombia is Home to the Pink River Dolphins</h3>
                        <p>Yes, you read that right. Deep in the Amazon rainforest in the dark water rivers, you’ll find
                            the
                            pale pink faces of the Pink River Dolphins. Just another of Colombia’s unique animal
                            species.
                            Fun Fact: You may notice the abnormal body shape of the dolphins, which is due to their
                            ability
                            to rotate their neck. This is a function typical dolphins lack.</p>
